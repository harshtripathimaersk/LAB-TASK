Welcome to the Assignment Repository! This repository contains the solutions for four different assignments related to AzureOpenAI, Redis Vector Store and Llama Index.

## Table of Contents

- [Assignment 1](#assignment-1) (Text Completion)
- [Assignment 2](#assignment-2) (Chat Completion)
- [Assignment 3](#assignment-3) (Data Ingestion )
- [Assignment 4](#assignment-4) (Llama Index with Redis)


## Assignments

### Assignment 1

## Objective: 
Create a Python script that uses Azure OpenAI to generate text completions based on user-provided prompts.

### Assignment 2

## Objective: 
Build a Python script that uses Azure OpenAI to simulate a basic chat interaction, generating responses based on user inputs in a conversational manner.

### Assignment 3

## Objective: 
To build an in-memory vector store that can ingest a document, generate embeddings, and answer queries using Llama-Index and Azure OpenAI. 


### Assignment 4

## Objective: 
The goal is to create an index from a set of documents, store it in Redis, and query the index to answer questions. If the Index is already present then fetch it from the Redis Vector Store otherwise store that index in the vector store.
